                    <p className='text-lg mb-3 text-white'>Orthopedic procedures are non-surgical injection-based procedures for people suffering from foot and ankle injuries, arthritis, or other conditions that cause pain. These procedures utilize <span class="highlight">concentrated repair cells</span> that are obtained from your own bone marrow or blood to promote your body's own natural ability to heal.

                        <br /> <br />

                    Current surgical treatment options for common ankle injuries and arthritis, include ankle arthroscopy to "clean up" damaged cartilage, fusion of ankle bones where cartilage has been lost, and tendon grafts screwed in place to strengthen loose connections between bones. All are painful and are often not be effective in the long run. These surgeries typically involve a painful post-surgical recovery with a lengthy rehab period to restore strength and mobility to the ankle. <span class="highlight">Regenexx may help reduce pain and improve function</span> for those with foot or ankle pain due to injury or arthritis eliminating the need for these invasive surgeries.

                                When the ligaments that hold the bones of the ankle joint together are 
                                partially torn or stretched, as in the case of a bad sprain or repeated 
                                minor sprains, they can become painful, loose, and weak. This changes how 
                                you walk, putting painful stress on other joints of the foot, as well as 
                                making it more likely that you will sprain the ankle again. This leads to 
                                a cycle of chronic pain and instability.

                        <span className="highlight-link">Regenexx-SD</span> is <span className="highlight-link">Bone Marrow Concentrate</span>. These repair cells from your own body live inside all of us in various tissues, poised to leap into action to repair damage as it occurs. As we age or have big injuries, we may not be able to recruit enough of these cells to the site to fully repair the area.

                        The <span className="highlight-link">Regenexx-SD</span> Procedure helps overcome this problem by harvesting <span className="highlight-link">Bone Marrow</span> from an area of the back of the hip that contains a dense population of these important cells and then concentrating those cells before precisely injecting them into the injured area using advanced imaging guidance.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The goal of the procedure is to reduce pain and improve function by promoting the body's own ability to heal naturally. This Patented <span className="highlight-link">Bone Marrow Concentrate</span> Protocol can be used for a wide range of orthopedic conditions. Your Regenexx doctor will evaluate your condition and your imaging to determine whether a <span className="highlight-link">bone marrow concentrate</span> or platelet-based treatment is the best option for your orthopedic condition.

                        <span className="highlight-link">Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP)</span> and <span className="highlight-link">Platelet Lysate</span> are Platelet procedures that contain healing <span className="highlight-link">growth factors</span> from your own blood that promote your body's natural ability to repair itself.

                    <p>
                        The use of <span className="highlight-link">PRP</span> to treat joint, tendon, ligament, and muscle injuries is becoming well known, thanks to exposure from professional athletes. Platelet injections have a stimulating effect on the repair cells within the targeted area, making those cells work harder to perform their natural job of healing the body. Like all Regenexx procedures, Regenexx <span className="highlight-link">SCP</span> procedures are performed with high-level imaging guidance to ensure the most accurate placements of cells into the desired area.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Our Advanced Platelet Procedures are more concentrated and purer than <span className="highlight-link">PRP</span> created by the automated machines used at most <span className="highlight-link">regenerative medicine</span> clinics, increasing the ability to stimulate the body's natural healing response. Platelet procedures are commonly used for soft tissue injuries, mild arthritis, spine conditions, and around nerves.
